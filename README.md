BackgroundTaskManager API provides the ability to chain multiple tasks into a singleton instance of backgroundTaskManager.It also includes the ability to process tasks SERIALLY ( tasks processed one after another) or in PARALLEL ( multiple tasks processed simultaneously).
This library handles thread processing as required and is optimised to handle tasks efficiently. Maximum PARALLEL tasks that can be executed simultaneously is computed and processed accordingly. 
If the TaskQueue exceeds the maximum available cores of a CPU, the all subsequent tasks are queued for execution. 
This also includes extended features invoking a callable function before or after completion of the tasks. This feature is wrapped in a familiar and easy method called before() and then().
